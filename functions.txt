Write a Javascript function, that uses the Phaser 3 framework, called updateAvatar_Capacity.  This function will get the values for lifeEnergyPool, lifeTargetEnergyPool (and 4 more, for focus and stamina respectively) from the this.playerData stored in a scene called DataModule.  The function then takes lifeEnergyPool / lifeTargetEnergyPool and stores the result (up to a maximum of 1.25) in the same this.playerData data object, under this.playerData.lifeCapacityBonus (and does the same for focus and stamina respectively).  Finally the function checks if lifeEnergyPool >= lifeTargetEnergyPool.  If so, it increases lifeTargetEnergyPool by 6% and also stores the value again in a seperate variable called newlifeTargetEnergyPool (the function does the same thing for focus and stamina respectively)
